Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The two selected projects, the SOS blinking LED's project and the final thermostat project, addressed different challenges. The SOS blinking LED's project involved programming the LaunchPad to flash the distress signal "SOS" in Morse code using onboard LEDs. In contrast, the final thermostat project required the implementation of drivers for a timer and an I2C temperature sensor to create a prototype thermostat using the LaunchPad. This thermostat indicated whether the heating was active through an LED, and users could set a target temperature using onboard buttons.

What did you do particularly well?
In both projects, the code created was efficient and logically structured. The skills acquired from previous lab assignments were instrumental in building upon this knowledge.

Where could you improve?
However, there is room for improvement, especially in the thermostat project. During refactoring, some artifacts from the previous build were unintentionally retained, potentially making the code more confusing. Future endeavors should focus on code cleanup and organization.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The LaunchPad proved to be a versatile tool, and the ample documentation and examples provided by TI were valuable resources. This experience with the LaunchPad and associated documentation will enhance skills and support future projects.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills gained from these projects, particularly in low-level hardware programming and memory management on resource-constrained MCUs, will be highly transferable to other projects and coursework. Managing memory efficiently in such systems and the practice obtained will be beneficial in various areas of learning.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To maintain, read, and adapt the projects, modularity was key. The main functions were kept clean, and code was organized into separate functions that could be called when needed. This modular approach enhances code readability and adaptability, allowing modifications to specific functions without altering the entire application.
